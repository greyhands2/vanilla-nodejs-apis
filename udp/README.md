// user datagram protocol(udp)
// most tcp and http cpnnections as handshakes as one node reaches out to another , agreeing on a protocol and then can share information but UDP is more like one node sending off information to another in hopes or under the assumption that the other node might receive it. UDP is often used in streaming services
